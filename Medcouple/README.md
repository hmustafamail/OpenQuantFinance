# Medcouple

- Efficient (N log N) implementation of Medcouple (otherwise quadratic)

## History
- Originally by another author (2015), who wrote it for Python 2
- It was not accepted into statsmodels due to licensing complications

## What I did
- Revised the code for Python 3
- Validated it against the (quadratic) statsmodels implementation
  - Data were provided by the previous author
  - RMSE was on the order of 1e-4
- Posted the revised code on Github on May 23, 2025
- Kept the GNU-GPL license
